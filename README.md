# TI-84_Plus_Font
The font for the TI-84 Plus is a classic, and appeared on many calculators in the past. Since the TI-84 Plus
CSE, the font changed and some users weren’t jazzed about it, and preferred the older font because of how
simple it was.

But how can you change the font for the TI-84 Plus CE? Don’t you need to learn z80 assembly? Yes!
Thanks to Iambian and his font editor, I have ported the TI-84 Plus OS font to the CE for you to relive the
good days of the typeface.

  How to use
For operating systems 5.3.0 and above, run it in RAM or archive (recommended) like a BASIC program. Once
installed, it will show `Font installed.’

For operating systems below 5.3.0 (you really should upgrade to 5.3.0 at least), unarchive it and use with
Asm() or run with Cesium.

Run again to uninstall.

*This font was created by Iambian's tool (not mine), but the font file I made is mine.*
